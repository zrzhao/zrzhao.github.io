title: A blog reborn
---
This is not a new blog. It is a blog reborn.

In 2007, I created a blog and called it "Fiscal Issues and Geeky Stuff." It was later moved to a UMN server operating through the "UThink" system. Over time, however, my blogging interests drifted away, in part because my limited social-media attention has been shifted to Weibo and then WeChat. Around 2013, the blog was abandomed as UMN discontinued the "UThink" blogging system.   

What has brought me back?

Maybe it is the Covid to "blaim." After working at home for more than two months, I decided to pick up some more coding this summer, now that I have cancelled all my travel plans. I learned Python, from books, from `Udemy`, from `YouTube` and from internet search. I adopted Jupyter Notebook. I picked up MarkDown. Today I registered to `GitHub` and played with `GitHub Pages`. On a whim, I decided to bring back this blog, based on a simple template called ["Jekyhll Now"](https://www.jekyllnow.com/). 

... and so we have this blog reborn, a place for me to play Python, MarkDown, and other geeky stuff, if nothing else.
